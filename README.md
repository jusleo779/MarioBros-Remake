Disclaimer: I coded almost everything in the game, from the player to the game manager code. Some of the code used in the player method is reused from a previous project from a course called "Game Dev Rockets". Things like movement, changing the direction the character 
is facing, and checking if the player is on the ground. However, aside from that, the player code was developed by me with minimal use of ChatGPT to resolve some minor issues. But besides the player code, everything was self-made with only the basic knowledge I learned from 
the Game Development Course. It's my first personal project in Unity.

I made a 2D platformer game where a character/player is running on platforms and dodging obstacles with "abilities" or "skills" that can be bought through the "black market." The character/player can wall jump only on the platforms with the big walls and not on the thin 
green platforms. I made it so that players aren't able to wall jump off the green platforms to make it harder for the player. There is a block that is pushable by the character when moving to help them get past obstacles. It made it hard
